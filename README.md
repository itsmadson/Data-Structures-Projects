## Projects

### 1. Maze Solver
**Description**:  
This project solves a 10x10 maze using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm implemented with a `deque` data structure. The user inputs the maze as text, where:
- `S` represents the start point.
- `E` represents the end point.
- `#` represents walls.

The program visualizes the original maze and the solved path side by side.

**Features**:
- BFS algorithm for finding the shortest path.
- Interactive GUI for maze input and visualization.
- Dark-themed design for a modern look.
- Arrows to show the direction of the solution path.

### 2. Engineering Calculator
**Description**:  
This project implements an engineering calculator using the Shunting Yard algorithm to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions. It supports basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), parentheses, and decimal numbers.

**Features**:
- Shunting Yard algorithm for expression parsing.
- Interactive GUI with a dark theme.
- Error handling for invalid expressions.

### 3. Heap Tree Visualization
**Description**:  
This project visualizes a max-heap data structure as a binary tree. Users can insert numbers into the heap and delete the root node. The tree is dynamically updated and displayed on the screen.

**Features**:
- Max-heap implementation with `heapify_up` and `heapify_down` functions.
- Tree visualization using `tkinter` canvas.
- Dark-themed design for better readability.

### 4. Music Player
**Description**:  
This project is a music player that uses a **circular doubly linked list** to manage the playlist. Users can add, remove, and play songs, as well as navigate between tracks using previous and next buttons.

**Features**:
- Circular doubly linked list for playlist management.
- Play, pause, next, and previous functionality.
- Modern, dark-themed GUI with a sleek design.
- Supports `.mp3` files.

## How to Run the Projects

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- The `tkinter` library (usually included with Python).
- The `pygame` library (for the Music Player). Install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```
